# Cryptada

Cryptada is a work in progress project which is basically a rewrite of [Cryptode](https://www.github.com/enginestein/Cryptode) which is a cryptography library for Rust.

For now there is only one section in Cryptada which is **adv** or **advanced algorithms** in full form. `adv` contains following features:

- Rot 13
- Base-Advanced encryption and decryption
- Transposition
- Utility functions
- Rot 13 - second version
